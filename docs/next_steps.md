# Next Steps

After finishing the [previous unit](adding_behavior.md) the [rating app](scenario_description.md) is
not finished, yet. This unit describes possible next steps for the rating app as well as further reading
regarding SAP RAP.

## Improving the Rating App

With the knowledge from this curriculum there are still many improvements possible for the rating app.
The following list contains just a few of them:

- Currently only the app to manage products ratings is implemented. The app for customers to
  add ratings is still missing. This app should allow customers to provide a rating. Possible by
  only allowing changes to the rating and review fields. This functionality could be achieved by:
  - Creating a projection of the business objects
  - Creating a specific behavior projection
  - Creating the necessary service definition and binding.
- Numerous usability improvements are possible foe the app.
