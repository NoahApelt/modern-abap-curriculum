# Modern ABAP Curriculum

This repository contains the documentation and source code for an [ABAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP)
curriculum developed as part of the [WiLMo](https://www.dh.nrw/kooperationen/OERContent.nrw%202021-95) project.

## Overview

### Learning Objectives

1. Students should be able to compare the advantages and disadvantages of using different extension technology for a given requirement
   based on a thorough understanding of the SAP S/4HANA architecture. This is required in order to select
   a suitable extension approach in a give scenario.
1. Students should be able to implement extension to a SAP S/4HANA system using state of the art ABAP in order to
   automate business processes not implemented in the SAP S/4HANA standard.
1. Students are able to implement extensions using the ABAP RAP framework and Fiori Elements in order to enhance
   SAP S/4HANA using the SAP best practices.
